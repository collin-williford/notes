What is Software?
- Instructions (computer programs) that when executed provide desired features, function and performance 
- data structures that enable the programs to adequately manipulate information and 
- Documentation that describes the operations and use of programs 

What is Software (vs other products)
- Software is developed or engineered, it is not manufactured in the classical sense 
- Software doesn't "wear out"
- Although the industry is moving toward component-based construction, most software continues to be custom-built 

Software Applicaitons 
- System Software
- Application Software 
- Engineering/Scientific Software
- Embedded software 
- Product-line software 
- Web/Mobile applications 
- AI Software (Robotics, Neural Nets, Game Playing)

Legacy Software 
- Software must be adapted to meed the needs of new computing environments or technology 
- Software must be enhanced to implement new business requirements 
- Software must be extended to make it interoperable with other more modern systems or databases 
- Software must be Re-Architected to make it viable within a network environment 

WebApps
- Modern WebApps are much more than hypertext files with a few pictures 
- WebApps are augmented with tools like XML and Java to allow Web engineers including interactive computing capability 
- WebApps may standalone capability to end users or may be integrated with corporate databases and business applications 
- Semantic web technologies (Web 3.0) have evolved into sophisticated corporate and consumer applications that encompass semantic databases that require web linking, flexible data representation, and applications programmer interfaces (API's) for access
- The asthetic nature of the content remains an important determinant of the quality of a WebApp

Mobile Apps
- Reside on mobile platforms such as phones, tablets, wearables
- Contain user interfaces that take both device characteristics and location attributes 
- Often provide access to a combination of web-based resources and local device processing and storage capabilities 
- Provide persistant storage capabilities within the platform 
- A mobile web application allows a mobile device to access to web-based content using a browser designed to accommodate the strengths and weaknesses of the mobile platform 
- A mobile app can give direct access to the hardware found on the device to provide local processing and storage capabilities 
- As time passes these differerences will become blurred 

Cloud Computing 
- Cloud Computing provides distributed data storage and processing resources to networked computing devices 
- Computing resources reside outside the cloud and have access to a variety of resources inside the cloud 
- Cloud computing requires developing an architecture containing both frontend and backend services 
- Frontend services include the client devices and application software to allow access 
- Backend services include servers, data storage, and server-resident applications 
- Cloud architectures can be segmented to restrict access to private data 

Defining the Discipline 
- The IEEE definition 
	- Software Engineering 
		- The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the devleopment, operation and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software 

Software Engineering Layers 
- Tools 
- Methods 
- Process 
- A quality focus 

Process Framework Activities 
- Communication 
- Planning
-  Modeling 
	- Analysis of requirements 
	- Design 
- Construction 
	- Code generation 
	- Testing 
- Deployment 

Unbrella Activities
- Software project tracking and control 
- Risk manageement 
- Software quality assurance 
- Technical reviews 
- Measurement 
- Software configuration management 
- Reusability management 
- Word product perparation and production 

Process Difference Requiring Adaption 
- Overall flow of activities, actions, and tasks and the interdependencies among them 
- Degree to which actions and tasks are defined within each framework activitiy
- Degree to which work products are identified and required 
- Manner to which quality assurance activities are applied 
- Manner n which project tracking and control activities are applied 
- Overall degree of detail and rigor with which the process is described 
- Degree to which the customer and other stakeholders are involved with the project
- Level of autonomy given to the software team 
- Degree to which team organization and roles are pescribed 

Essence of Software Engineering Practice 
- Understand the problem 
	- Who has a stake in the solution to the problem 
	- What are the unknowns 
	- Can the problem be compartmentalized
	- Can the problem be represented graphically 
- Plan a Solution 
	- Have you seen similar problems before 
	- Has a similar problem been solved 
	- Can subproblems be defined 
	- Can you represent a solution in a manner that leads to effective implementation 
- Carryout the Plan
	- Does the solution conform to the plan 
	- Is each component part of the solution provably corrected 
- Examine the Result 
	- Is it possible to test each component part of the solution 
	- Does the solution produce results, that conform to the data, functions, and features that are required 

Hooker's General Principles 
- The Reason It All Exists 
	- provide value to users 
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
	- Design simple as it can be 
- Maintain the Vision 
	- Clear vision is essential 
- What You Produce, Others Will Consume 
- Be Open to the Future
	- Do not design yourself into a corner 
- Plan Ahead for Reuse 
	- Reduces cost and increases value 
- Think
	- Placing thought before action produce results 

How it all starts 
- Every software project is precipitated by some business need 
	- The need to correct a defect in an existing application 
	- the need to the need to adapt a 'legacy system' to a changing business environment 
	- the need to extent the functions and features of an existing application
	- the need to create a new product, service or system
