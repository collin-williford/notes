Process Flows
- Linear process flow 
- Iterativ process flow 
- Evolutionary process flow 
- Parallel process flow 

Identifying a Task Set 
- A task set defines the actual work to be done to accomplish the objectives of a software engineering action 
- A task set is defined by creating several lists:
	- A list of tasks to be accomplished 
	- A list of work products to be produced 
	- A list of the quality assurance filters to be applied 

Process Assessment and Improvement 

Waterfall Process Model 
- pros 
	- It is easy to understand and plan 
	- It works for well-understood small projects 
	- Analysis and testing are straightforward 
- Cons 
	- It does not accommodate change well 
	- Testing occurs late in the process
	- Customer approval is at the end 

Prototyping Process Model 
- Pros 
	- Reduced impact of requirement changes
	- Customer is involved early and often 
	- Works well for small projects 
	- Reduced likelihood of product rejection 
- Cons 
	- Customer involvement may cause delays 
	- Temptation to "ship" a prototype 
	- Work host in a throwaway prototype 
	- Hard to plan and manage 

Spiral Process Model 
- Pros 
	- Continuous customer involvement 
	- Development risks are managed 
	- Suitable for large, complex projects 
	- It works well for extensible products 
- Cons 
	- Risk analysis failures can doom the project 
	- Project may be hard to manage 
	- Requires an expert development team 

Unified Process Model 
- Pros 
	- Quality documentation empphasized 
	- Continuous customer involvement 
	- Accommodates requirements changes 
	- Works well for maintenance projects 
- Cons 
	- Use cases are not always precise 
	- Tricky software increment integration 
	- Overlapping phases can cause problems 
	- Requires expert development team 

Prescriptive Process Models
- Prescriptive process models advocate an orderly approach to software engineering 
- That leads to a two questions 
	- If prescriptive process models strive for structure and order, are they appropriate for a software world that thrives on change?
	- If reject traditional process models adn replace them with something less structured, do we make it impossible to achieve coordination and coherence in software work?

Software engineering 
- A concerted effort should be made to understand the problem before a software solution is developed 
- Design becomes a pivotal activity 
- Software should exhibit high quality 
- Software should be maintainable
