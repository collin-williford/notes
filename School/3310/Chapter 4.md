Recommended Process Model 

Adapting Process Models 
- Every software project needs a "road map" or "generic software process" of some kind 
- Every project is different, and every team is different 
- No single software engineering framework is appropriate for every software product 
- Any road map or generic process should be based on best industry practices 
- Developers and stakeholders adapt generic process models and tailor them to fit the current project, the skills of team memebers, and the user needs

Principles for Organizing Software Projects 
- It is risky to use a linear process model without ample feedback 
- Is is never possible nor desirable to plan big up-front requirements gathering 
- Up-front requirements gathering may not reduce costs or prevent time slippage 
- Appropriate project management is integral to software development 
- Documents should evolve with the software and should not delay the start of construction 
- Invoke stakeholders early and frequently in the development process 
- Testers need to become involved in the process prior to software construction 

Characteristics of Spiral Process Model 
- Not suitable for small, low-risk projects
- Several steps required, along with documentation done up front 
- Early involvement of testers (might be done by outside team)
- Hard to accommodate product changes until prototype completed 
- Continuous stakeholder involvement
