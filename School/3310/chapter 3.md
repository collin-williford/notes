Agility and Process

What is Agility?
- Effective (rapid and adaptive) response to change 
- Effective commuincatoin among all stakeholders
- Drawing the customer onto the team 
- Organizing a team so that is it in control f the work performed 
- Rapid, incremental delivery of softwar

What is an Agile Process?
- Driven by customer descriptions of what is required (scenarios) 
- Customer feedback is frequent and acted on 
- Recognized that plans are short-lived 
- Develops software iteratively with a heavy emphasis on construction activities 
- Delivery multiple 'software increments' as executable prototypes 
- Adapts as project or technical changes occur 

Agile Principles
- Customer satisfactions is achieved by providing value through software that is delivered to the customer as rapidly as possible 
- Developers recognize that requirements will change and welcome changes 
- Deliver software increments frequently (weeks not months) to stakeholders to ensure feedback on their deliveries is meaningful
- Agile team populated by motivated individuals using face-to-face communication to convey information 
- Team process encourages technical execellence, good design, simplicity, and avoids unnecessary work 
- Working software that meets customer needs is the primary goal 
- Pace and direction of team's work must be "sustainable" enabling them to work effectively for long periods of time
- An agile team is a "self-organizing team" - one that can be trusted developed well-structured architectures that lead to solid designs and customer satisfaction 
- Part of the team culture is to consider its work introspectively with the intent of imporoving how to become more effective its primary goal (customer satisfaction)

Scrum Details 
- Backlog Refinement Meeting 
	- Developers work with stakeholders to create product backlog 
- Spring Planning Meeting 
	- Backlog partitioned into "sprints" derived from backlog and next sprint defined 
- Daily Scrum Meeting 
	- Team members synchronize their activities and plan work day (15 minutes max)
- Sprint Review 
	- Prototype "demos" are delivered to the stakeholders for approval or rejection 
- Sprint Retrospective 
	- After sprint is complete, team considers what went well and what needs improvement 
- Pros 
	- Product owner sets priorities 
	- Team owns decision making 
	- Documentation is lightweight
	- Supports frequent updating 
- Cons 
	- Difficult to control the cost of changes
	- May not be suitable for large teams 
	- Requires expert team members

Extreme Programming Details 
- XP Planning 
	- Begins with user stories, team estimates cost, stories gropued into increments, commitment made on delivery date, computer project velocity 
- XP Design 
	- Follows KIS principle, encourages use of CRC cards, design prototypes, and refactoring 
- XP Coding 
	- Construct unit test before coding, uses pair 
- XP testing 
	- Unit tests executed daily, acceptance tests define by customer 
- Pros 
	- Emphasized customer involvement 
	- Established rational plans and schedules 
	- High developer commitiment to the project 
	- Reduced likelihood of project rejection 
- Cons
	- Temptation to "ship" a prototype 
	- Requires frequent meetings about increasing costs 
	- Allows for execessive changes 
	- Depends on highly skilled team members 

Kanhan Details 
- Visualizing workflow using a Kanhan board 
- Limiting the amount of work in progress at any given time 
- Managing workflow to reduce waste by understanding the current value flow 
- Making process policies explicit and the criteria used to define "done"
- Focusing on continuous improvement by creating feedback loops where changes are introduced 
- Make process changes collaboratively and involve all stakeholders as needed 
- Pros 
	- Lower budget and time requirements 
	- Allows early product delivery 
	- Process policies written down 
	- Continuous process improvement 
- Cons 
	- Team collaboration skills determine success 
	- Poor business analysis can doom the project 
	- Flexibility can cause developers to lose focus 
	- Developer reluctance to use measurement
