**Software design concepts** 
- Abstraction 
	- Considers the components, neglects implication details. Procedural and Data abstraction 
- Architecture 
	- overall structure or organization of software components, ways components interact, and structure of data used by components 
- Design Patterns 
	- Describe a design structure that solves a well-defined problem within a specific context 
- Separation of Concerns 
	- Any complex problem can be more easily handled if its subdivided into pieces 
- Modularity 
	- separates the "Separation of concerns" into modules 
- Information Hiding 
	- Designing of modules so that the algorithms and local data contained within them are inaccessible to other modules 
- Functional Indedependence 
	- Single-minded (high cohesion) components with aversion to execssion interaction with other components (low coupling)
- Stepwise Refinement 
	- Incremental elaboration of detail for all abstractions 
- Refactoring
	- A reorganization technique that simplifies the design without changing functionality 
- Design Classes
	- Provide design detail that will enable analysis classes to be implemented 

Quality attributes in design 
- Functionality 
- Usability (UX)
- Reliability 
- Performance 
- Supportability 

Why design is not coding 
- design is high-level abstraction 
- code is low-level abstraction 

Design Modules 
- Data Design Elements 
	- creates a model of data and/or information that is represented at a high level of abstraction 
- Architecture Elements 
	- Gives an overall view of the software (like the floorplan of a house)
- Interface elements 
	- Describes the externally observable behavior of a class 
- Component level elements 
	- describes the internal detail of each software component 
- Deployment-level elements 
	- Indicates how software functionality and sub-systems will be allocated within the physical computing environment 

Single word to describe the importance of computing?
- Quality 

**Software Architecure** 

Architectural Genres 
- Artifical intelligence 
- Device 
- Financial 
- Government 
- Legal 
- Military 
- Medical 

Architectural Styles 
- Data-Centered 
	- A datastore (file or database) resides at the center of this architecture and is accessed frequently by other components that update, add, delete or modify data within the store 
- Data-flow 
	- When input data are to be transformed through a series of computational or manipulative components into output data 
- Call-and-Return 
	- Main program/subprogram architectures 
		- A control hierarchy where a "main" program invokes several program components 
	- Remote procedure call architecture s
		- Components of a main program/subprogram architectures are distributed across multiple computers on a network 
- Object-oriented
	- The components of a system encapsulates data and the operations that must be applied to manipulate data 
- Layered 
	- A number of different layers are defined, each accomplishing operations that progressively become closer to the machine instruction set 

Architecture Description language 
- UML 
- A language used to describe the architecture of a software system
