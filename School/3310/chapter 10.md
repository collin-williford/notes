What is Software Architecture 
- The architecture is not the operational software, it is a representation that enables a software engineer to 
	- Analyze the effectiveness of the design in meeting its stated requirements 
	- Consider architectural alternatives at a stage when making design changes is still relatively easy 
	- Reduce the risks associated with the construction of the software

Why is Software Architecture Important?
- Software architecture provides a representation that facilitates communication among all stakeholders interested in the development of a computer-based system 
- Architecture highlights early design decisions that will have profound impact on all software engineering work that follows 
- Architecture constitutes a relatively small, intellectually graspable mode of how the system is structured and how its components work together 

Architecture Design Documentation 
- Determine information items needed for each decision 
- Define links between each decision and appropriate requirements 
- Provide mechanisms to change status when alternative decisions need to be evaluated 
- Define prerequisite relationships among decisions to support traceability 
- Link significant decisions to architectural views resulting from decisions 
- Document and communicate all decisions as they are made 

Agility and Architecture 
- To avoid rework, user stories are used to create and evolve an architectural model (walking skeleton) before begnning any coding 
- Use models which allow software architects to add user stories to the evolving storyboard and works with the product owner to prioritize the architectural stories as "sprints" (work units) are planned 
- Well run agile projects include delivery of architectural documentation during each sprint 
- After the sprint is completed, the architecture reviews the working prototype for quality before the team presents it to the stakeholders in a formal sprint review
