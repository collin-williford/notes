What is software?
- instructions that when executed provide desired features, function, and performance 
- data structures that enable the programs to adequately manipulate information 
- documentation that describes the operation and use of the programs 

Process Framework Activities
- Communication 
- Planning 
- Modeling 
- Construction 
- Deployment 

Umbrella Activities
- Software project tracking and control 
- Risk management 
- Software quality assurance 
- Technical reviews 
- Measurement 
- Software configuration management 
- Reusability management 
- Work product preparation and production 

Polya's problem solving principles 
- Understand the problem (communication and analysis) 
- Plan a solution (modeling and software design)
- Carry out the plan (code generation)
- Examine result for accuracy (testing and quality assurance)

Hooker's General Principles 
- The reason it all exists 
	- provide value to users
- KISS
	- design simple as it can be 
- Maintain the vision 
	- clear vision is essential 
- What you produce, others will consume 
- Be open to the future 
	- do not design yourself into a corner 
- Plan ahead for reuse 
	- reduces cost and increases value 
- Think 
	- planing through before action produces results 

Waterfall method pros and cons 
- Pros 
	- It is easy to understand and plan 
	- it works for well-understood small projects 
	- Analysis and testing is straightforward
- Cons 
	- it does not accommodate change well 
	- Testing occurs late in the process
	- Customer approval is at the end 

Prototyping Processes Model pros and cons 
- Pros 
	- Reduced impact of requriement changes 
	- Customer is involved early and often 
	- Works well for small projects 
	- Reduced likelihood of produce rejection 
- Cons 
	- Customer involvement may cause delays 
	- Temptation to "ship" a prototype 
	- Work lost in a throwaway prototype 
	- Hard to plan and manage 

Sprial Process Model 
- Pros 
	- Continuous customer involvement 
	- Development risks are managed
	- Suitable for large, complex projects
	- Work well for extensible products 
- Cons 
	- Risk analysis failures can doom the project 
	- Project may be hard to manage 
	- Requires an expert development team 

Unified process model 
- Pros
	- Quality documentation emphasized 
	- Continuous customer involvement 
	- Accommodates requirement changes 
	- Works well for maintenance projects 
- Cons 
	- Use cases are not always precise 
	- Tricky software increment integration 
	- Overlapping phases can cause problems 
	- Requires expert development team 

Tradeoffs by the Agile Manifesto 
- Individuals and interations over processes and tools 
- Working software over comprehensive documentation 
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
- Responding to change over following a plan
