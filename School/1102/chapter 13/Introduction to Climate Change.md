Introduction to Climate Change 
- Climate change is caused from both natural processes and human activites. The global temperature is increasing, and the main cause of this type of climate change appears to be human activities e.g., buring fossil fuels 

Who Monitors Climate Change?
- IPCC
	- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 

Reconstructing Past Climates 
- Techniques 
	- Glacial Landscapes 
	- CLIMAP 
		- Climate: Long-Range Investigation Mapping and Prediction 
	- Dendrochronology - Tree Rings
	- Lake - bottom sediment and soil deposits 
	- Pollen in deep ice caves, sil deposits and sea sediments 
	- Geologoical evidence and change in water level of closed basin lakes 
	- Documents concerning droughts, floods, crop yields, etc
	- Ogygen-isotope ratios of corals 

Climate Throught the Ages
- The global climate throughout Earth's history was probably much warmer than it is today. Polar regions were free from ice (estimates are 82% of Earth's history is without ice). There have been different climate periods, from Ice Age to Interglacial periods 

Temperature trends during the past 1000 years:
- Little Ice Age | Late 1400's, through early 1800's 

Temperature trends during the past 100 plus years:
- Average global surface temperature rise, but not uniform around the globe. Global warming is a trend that is well documented
