White and Colors 
- Sunlight enters the atmosphere and is either absorbed, reflected, scattered, or transmitted on through. Our preception of light comes from radiant energy from the sun, traveling out ward in the form of electromagnetic waves. This stimulates the rods and cones in the human eye 
- White light are all visible wavelengths that strike cones with nearly equal intensity 

Clouds and Scattered Light 
- Reflection 
	- Sunlight bounces off a surface at the same angle at which it strikes the surface
- Scattered light 
	- Diffuse light 
	- No energy is gained or lost 
	- No temperature changes occur 
- Cloud droplets scatter all wavelengths of visible white light about equally. The different colors represent different wavelengths of visible light 
- Clouds - Why are they white 
	- Since tiny cloud droplets scatter visible ligth in all directions, light from many billions of droplets turns a cloud white 
- Average percent of radiation reflected, absorbed, and transmitted by clouds of various thickness 
	- Notice thicker clouds reflect and absorb more and transmit less 

Blue Skies and Hazy Days
- Selective Scattering 
	- Each oxygen and nitrogen air molecule scatters shorter waves of visible light much more effectively than longer waves 
	- unlike a cloud, air molecules scatter certain wavelengths more easily 
- Why is the sky blue 
	- They sky appears blue because billions of air molecules selectively scatter the shorter wavelengths of visible light more effectively than the longer ones. This causes us to see blue light coming from all directions 
- Blue Skies 
	- The selective scattering of blue light by air molecules produces the blue sky, while the scattering of all wavelengths of visible light by liquid cloud droplets produces the white clouds 

Red Suns and Blue Moons 
- Midday, the sun seems a brilliant white, while at sunset, it usually appears to be yellow, orange or red. This is due to the low angle (sunrise or sunset) that causes light to travel through more atmosphere. Shorter waves of visible light have been scattered away by the air molecules, so that only yellow, orange, and red make it through. This is the same process for a blue moon.
