Twinkling and Twilight
- Transmission and Refraction 
	- Transmission is light that passes through a substance. Refraction occurs when light enters a substance at an angle and bends. The amount depends on material density and the angle at which light enters the material 
- Density 
	- Light that travels from a less-dense to a more-dense medium loses speed and bends toward the normal. Light that enters a less-dense medium increases speed and bends away from normal
- Scintillation 
	- Scintillation is the reflection, bending and changing apparent position that causes the winkling of a star
- Twilight 
	- Twilight is the time after sunset when the sky remains illuminated and allows outdoor activities to continue without artificial lighting 

Halos and Sundogs 
- Halo 
	- Ring of light encircling and extending outward from the sun or moon 
		- Most common: 22^o halo 
		- Tangent arc: bright arc of light may be seen at top of 22^o halo 
	- Dispersion 
		- Breaking up of white light by "selective" refraction 

Rainbows
- Occur when rain if falling in one part of the sky while the sun is shining in another 
	- To see a rainbow, face the falling rain with the sun at your back 
- Rainbow types 
	- Primary 
	- Secondary 
- Rainbow formation 
	- Sunlight internally refelected and dispersed by a raindrop 
	- Refraction of the light as it enters the drop causes the point of reflection to be different for each color. Hence, the colors are separated from each other when the light emerges from the raindrop
