Here is an example of a climatology forecast and a look at probability forecasts 
- Nowcast
	- Few hours (<6), includes watches, warnings and advisories 
- Short-range 
	- 12 hours to a few days 
- Medium-range 
	- Three to eight days 
- Long-range 
	- Beyond eight days 
- Seasonal outlooks 
	- Three-month periods that overlap and extend out to roughly a year 

Forecasting Accuracy 
- National Weather Service forecast accuracy within 12 to 24 hours is usually quite accurate 
- Skill is more accurate than a forecast based on only persistence or climatology 
	- Weather forecasts ranging from 12 hours to a few days usually shows how much more skill than persistence forecasts
