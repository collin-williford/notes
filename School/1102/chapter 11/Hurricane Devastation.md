Hurricane Devastation 
- Hurricanes have Three Primary Devestating impacts 
	- High winds 
	- Storm surge
	- Flooding 

Categorization 
- Saffir-Simpson Scale of Tropical Hurricane Intensity 
	- (1) Weak
		- > 980mb central pressure
		- 33-42 Mean wind, m/sec (74-95mph)
		- 1.2m-1.7m Storm surge 
	- (2) Moderate
		- 965-979mb central pressure
		- 43-49m/sec Mean Wind (96-110mph)
		- 1.8m-2.6m Storm surge
	- (3) Strong 
		- 945-964mb Central pressure
		- 50-58m/sec Mean wind (111-130mph)
		- 2.7-3.8m Storm surge
	- (4) Very Strong 
		- 920-944mb Central Pressure
		- 59-69m/sec Mean Wind, (131-155mph)
		- 3.9-5.6m Storm Surge
	- (5) Devastating 
		- < 920mb Central pressure
		- > 69m/sec Mean Wind (>155mph)
		- > 5.6m Storm Surge (>18ft)

Storm Surge
- Storm Surge is the primary cause of death and damage in tropical cyclones outside of the U.S.
- The rise in sea level due to a hurricane's winds and low atmospheric pressure 

If hurricane winds around the storm are 100 knots, and the system is moving 25 knots North, what would be the max wind speeds on the left and right sides of the storm?
- Left 75 knots
- Right 125 knots 

Flooding and Tornadoes 
- Flooding tends to cause the most loss of life in the U.S. from Hurricanes 

Hurricane-Spawned Tornadoes
- About one-fourth of the hurricanes that strike the U.S. produce tornadoes and considerable damage can occur 

It is impossible for a tornado to form in a hurricane
- False
