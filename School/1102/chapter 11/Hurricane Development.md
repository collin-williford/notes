Hurricane Basics
- Topical Weather
	- Hurricanes develop in topical weather regions, which is a board belt around Earth. The weather in this belt is much different than in middle latitudes 
	- Differences between topical weather and middle latitude weather:
		- Difference 1
			- Noon sun is always high in the sky 
		- Diff 2
			- Seasonal temperature changes are small
		- Diff 3
			- Daily heating and humidity favor cumulus clouds and afternoon thunderstorms 
- What is a Hurricane
	- A hurricane is a large storm system, usually around 300-400 miles in diameter with sustained winds greater than 64 knots (74 mph). They have different names depending on location: Typhoon, Cyclone, and Hurricane 

Ingredients for Hurricane Formation 
- Warm sea-surface temps (SST's) - greater than 26c (79f)
- deep moistuer at low levels 
- light winds throughout troposphere
- need convergence, a trigger
	- Weak frontal boundary 
	- ITCZ
- Typically form between 5-20 latitude, not on equator

Structure of Hurricanes
- Eye
- Eyewall
	- The innermost band of thunderstorms which surrounds the eye 
- Rainbands
	- The spiral bands of thunderstorms that extend outward from the hurricane center

The **eyewall** is the innermost band of thunderstorms which surround the eye 

Hurricane Formation and Dissipation 
- The right enviroment for hurricane formation includes tropical waters with light wind, high humidity, and warm surface 
- This results in a developing storm with a cluster of thunderstorms around a central area of surface low pressure and eyewall replacement, which is dissipation of the original hyewall and formation of new one farther out from the eye 

Where does a hurricane get it's energy?
- Sensible heat 
- Latent heat 
- Initially, need an unstable enviroment:
	- Cold air aloft, warm air at the surface, this leads to the growth of thunderstorms 

Which of the following statements correctly describes the difference between latent heat and sensible heat?
- Latent heat is driven by condensation, and Sensible heat is given off by the ocean 

Stages of Development 
- Tropical Disturabance (Wave)
	- The birth of a hurricane having only a slight circulation with no closed isobars around an area of low pressure
	- Topical distrubances commonly exist in the tropical trade winds at any one time and are often accompanied by clouds and precipitation 
- Tropical Depression 
	- If sustained winds increase to at least 20 knots, a distrubance is upgraded to a topical depression 
	- Surface wind speeds vary between 20 and 34 knots 
	- A tropical depression has at least one closed isobar that accompanies a drop in pressure in the center of the storm 
- Topical Storm 
	- If sustained wind speeds increase to at least 35 knots, a tropical depression is upgraded to a tropical storm 
	- Surface wind speeds vary between 35 and 64 knots and the storm becomes more organized 
	- Tropical storms resemble the appearance of hurricanes due to the intensified circulation 
- Hurricane 
	- As surface pressures continue to drop, a tropical storm becomes a hurricane when sustained wind speeds exceede 64 knots 
	- A pronounce drotation develops around the central core as sprial rain bands rotate around the eye of the storm 
	- The heaviest precipitation and strongest winds are associated with the eye 
- Hurricane Formation and Dissipation 
	- The storm dies out 
		- Hurricanes weaken when they travel over colder water and lose their heat source 
	- Hurricane stages of development 
		- Tropical distrubance 
		- Tropical depression 
			- 20-34 knots 
		- Tropical storm 
			- 35-63 knots 
		- Hurricane 
			- > 64 knots 

Hurricane Size 
- **Typical hurricanes are about 300 miles wide** although they can vary considerably, as shown in the two enhanced satellite images below. Size is not necessarily an indication of hurricane intensity. Hurricane Andrew (1992) the most devastating hurricane of this century, was a relatively small hurricane 

Hurricane Tracking 
- **A hurricane watch** is issuesd 24-48 hours before the storm arrives 
- A **hurricane warning** is issued when it becomes more certain that the storm will strike the area

Hurricane Formation and Dissipation 
- Investigating the storm 
	- Visible, infrared, and enhanced infrared satellite images 
	- Hurricane hunter instruments 
- Hurricane movement 
	- General tracks: west, northwest, north, and northeast
		- Considerable variation 
- North Atlantic hurricanes 
	- Form over the tropical North Atlantic and move westward or northwestward on a collision course with Central or North America
		- Most hurricanes swing away from land and move northward, parallel to the U.S. coastline 
- Eastern Pacific hurricanes
	- Form off the coast of Mexico over the Northeast Pacific 

What are the general tracks a hurricane will take?
- North 
- Northeast
- West
- Northwest
