Gradient = (delta)value / distance 
- Gradient shows how quickly the value changes from one point to another 
	- A steep (high) gradient changes quickly and the isolines are close together 
	- A gentile (low) gradient changes slowly and the lines are far apart 

What is the primary purpose of drawing contour lines on a topographic map?
- To connect points of similar elevation to visualize changes in terrain 

In the context of contour maps, why is it important for contour lines to never intersect?
- Intersecting lines result in incorrect representation of data
