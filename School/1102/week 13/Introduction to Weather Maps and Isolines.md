Weather Map Overview
- Weather maps are graphical representations of weather data collected from various weather stations worldwide
- Isolines
	- ISO Lines (Isopleths) are lines conecting points of equal value of a specific weather variable, such as temperature or pressure. They help visualize patterns and gradients in weather data 

Station Models 
- Station models are symbols used to depict weather observations at specific locations on the map. Station models provide a concise way of presenting weather informaiton at a specific location 
	- Elements of Station Models 
		- Cloud Cover 
			- Cloud cover is represented by symbols (e.g., circles or lines) and indicates the amount of cloud cover at the station 
		- Wind Direction/Speed
			- Wind Direction is shown by a line pointing in the direction from which the wind is blowing, and wind speed is depicted by the number of "feathers" on the wind barb
		- Temperature
			- Temperature is displayed in degrees Fahrenheit or Celcius 
		- Dew Point 
			- Dew Point is displayed in Fahrenheit or Celsius
		- Weather Conditions 
			- Are abbreviated (e.g., "RA" for rain, "SN" for snow) and indicate the current weather at the station 
		- Visibility 
			- Represents the horizontal visibility range in miles or kilometers 

Reading and Interpreting Station Models for Weather Analysis 
- Interpreting a station model involves understanding the weather elements presented and their significance in assessing weather conditions 
- Analyzing the wind direction and speed helps identify wind patterns and potential weather systems 
- Comparing temperature and dew point provides insights into humidity levels and potential for precipitation 
- Weather conditions and visibility offer an understanding of the current weather at the station
