Concept of Isolines 
- Examples of Isolines 
	- Isotherms 
		- Points of equal temperature 
	- Isobar
		- Points of equal barometric (air) pressure
	- Contour
		- Points of equal latitude 
	- Concentration of chemicals 
	- Anything else you can get a value for 

In areas of low pressure, the measurements are **below** 1,000

Rules for Drawing Isolines 
- Isolines connect points of equal value 
- Isolines are gentile, curving lines - no sharp corners 
- Isolines are always closed curves even though the map might show part of it 
- Isolines NEVER cross - this would mean that one point has two different values.
- Isolines are usually parallel (they have a parallel trend)

On a Temperature Plot, Gradients are the location of **Weather Systems**

Interpreting Contour Maps
Contours
- Lines of equal value -> isolines
- Lines seperating higher and lower vaules 
- Different names depending on data being contoured 
	- Pressure: Isobars
	- Temperature: Isotherms 
	- Dew Point: isodrosotherms
	- Height: isoheights 
	- Wind: isotachs

Contour Guidelines 
- Always use pencil first 
- Draw smooth, continuous contour lines 
	- No 90 degree angles 
- Contours should not cross or intersect 
- Even spacing of contours between data points
