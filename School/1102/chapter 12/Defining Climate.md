Introduction to Climate 
- Types of climate
	- Microclimate 
		- Very near the ground in a small zone where surface properties are consistent 
	- Mesoclimate 
		- Regions such as forests, valleys, beaches, and towns 
	- Macroclimate
		- Large state or a small nation 
	- Global climate 
		- The entire earth 
- climate controls 
	- Latitude 
	- Land and water 
	- Ocean currents 
	- Prevaling winds 
	- Pressure winds
	- Pressure areas 
	- Mountain barriers 
	- Altitude 

A World with Many Climates 
- Climate comes down to two different things for people 
	- Global Temperatures 
		- Isotherms bend due to land heating and cooling, ocean currents, and upwelling 
	- Global Precipitation 
		- Precipitation is most abundant where the air rises, least abundant where it sinks 

What pressure systems form at each latitude?
- 0(deg) -> ITCZ
- 30(deg) -> Subtropical High 
- 60(deg) -> Polar Front 
- North/South Pole -> Polar High 

The Mountain Effect causes an increase in moisture on the downwind side of a mountain range 
- False
