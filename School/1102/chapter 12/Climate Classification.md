The Koppen Classification System 
- The Koppen Classification System was created in 1918 by Waldimir Koppen. It relates vegetation and climate to predict climate types without climatological data. These classification were
	- Tropical Moist Climates 
	- Dry Climates 
	- Moist mid-latitude climates with mild winters 
	- Moist mid-latitude climates with severe winters
	- Polar Climates 

How do we classify 
- Most of the time, climate is broken down by temperature and precipitation 
	- Tropical 
	- Mesothermal 
	- Microthermal 
	- Polar 
	- Deserts 
	- Highland 

Current Classification Categories 
- Tropical Climates 
- Mesothermal Climates 
- Microthermal Climates 
- Polar Climates 
- Highland Climates 
- Dry, Arid, and Semiarid Climates 

Tropical Climates 
- There are three kinds of Tropical Climates 
	- Tropical Rain Forest 
	- Tropical Monsoon 
	- Tropical Savanna 

Tropical 
- Tropical moist climates 
	- General charactersistics
		- Year-round warm temperatures abundant rainfall 
			- Extent: northward and southward from the equator to about 15(deg) to 25(deg)
			- Major types: Tropical wet (rain forest), tropical monsoon and tropical savanna 
- Tropical Climates 
	- Tropical Rain Forest 
		- rainy all year long 
	- Tropical Monsoon 
		- 6 to 12 months of rain 
	- Tropical Savanna 
		- < 6 months of rain 

Mesothermal Climates 
- There are three kinds of Mesothermal Climates 
	- Humid Subtropical 
		- Moist all year, hot summers 
	- Marine West Coast 
		- Moist all year, warm to cool summers
	- Mediterranean 
		- Dry, hot summers 

Microthermal Climates 
- There are two kinds of Microthermal Climates 
	- Humid Continental 
		- Hot summers, moist all year, cold winters 
	- Subartic Climates 
		- cool summers, very cold winters 

Polar Climates 
- Tundra Climate
	- Land under continuous snowcover for 8-10 months 
- Ice Cap climate 
	- All months below freezing 
- Ice Sheet Climate 
	- All months below freezing 
- Polar Marine Climate 
	- No month averages less than 20 F 

Dry, Arid and Semiarid Climates 
- Low-Altitude Hot Desert Climates 
- Midlatitude Cold Desert Climates 
- Low-Latitude Hot Steppe Climates 
- Midlatitude Cold Steppe Climates 

The Global Pattern of Climate 
- Dry Climates 
	- Geneal characteristics
		- Deficient precipitation most of the year, potential evaporation and transpiration exceed precipitation 
			- Extent
				- Subtropical deserts extend roughly 20(deg) and 30(deg) latitude in large continental regions of the middle latitudes, often surrounded by mountains 
			- Major Types
				- Arid and semi-arid 

Highland Climates 
- Decreases in temperature with altitude 
	- Great deal of variation in temperature, precipitation, and vegetation over a relatively short vertical change in elevation
