- What is potential vs Kinetic energy - how it kinetic energy defined in the atmosphere?
	- Potential 
		- Energy that hasn't been used up 
		- stored up availab eenergy 
	- Kinetic 
		- Energy of motion 
		- Kinetic energy in the atmosphere is temperature 
		- How fast are the air molecules moving right now?
		- increase the temperature of a room 
			- molecules have more energy 
			- moving around more
			- have higher kinetic energy 
- Know the difference between warm and cold air 
	- warm 
		- because it has so much kinetic energy it expands 
	- cold 
		- doesn't have much energy 
		- compress down 
- What are the main differences between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin?
	- Fahrenheit 
		- used around the united states
	- Celsius
		- around the world 
		- freezing points of water at zero 
		- boiling point 100 degrees 
	- Kelvin 
		- used in science
		- doesn't drop below zero 
		- friendly for math 
- What are Heat Capacity and Specific Heat?
	- heat capacity 
		- how much energy can an object hold or store?
		- water is able to store a tremendous amount of energy when you compare it to land or air
			- water has high heat capacity 
	- Specific heat 
		-  Takes a lot of energy to increase its temperature
- Which has a higher heat capacity? Water or Land?
	- water 
		- higher
		- takes a lot of energy to increase its temperature 
	- land 
		- lower
		- heat and cool very quickly 
- What is latent heating and how does it effect temperature?
	- latent heating 
		- When water changes phase 
		- when water evaporates
			- requires energy to go from the liquid state into the gas state 
			- ice doesn't have much energy 
			- liquid has more than ice and gas as more than liquid 
				- to go from liquid to gas you have to have energy 
					- add heat 
					- takes that heat from surrounding environment 
		- water condenses
			- increase in temperature 
- Latent heats of evaporation and condensation 
	- when it rains outside, it feels colder out 
	- rain droplets are evaporating and lowering the temperature 
- heat transfer = conduction and convection 
	- conduction 
		- touching something 
		- molecule to molecule 
		- Transfer of energy 
	- convection 
		- smoke rising 
		- energy transfer by movement 
- What is advection?
	- when heat moves from one place to another
	- generally carried by wind 
- What is the difference between longwave and shortwave energy?
	- longwave
		- peaks are far away
		- longer you make the waves the less energy it has 
		- low energy radiation 
		- radio waves, microwaves, infrared
	- shortwave
		- peaks are close 
		- gamma rays, x rays, ultraviolet ways, visible 
- What is the EM spectrum and what are the primary types of solar and Earth radiation?
	- spectrum of all types of radiation out there
	- sun primarily gives off visible radiation 
	- Earth primary radiation is infrared 
- What is the Greenhouse effect? Natural? Man-made?
	- Visible light coming into earth get trapped in by clouds, water vapor, CO2
	- greenhoue gases 
		- CO2
		- methane
		- water vapor 
	- Infrared reaches the CO2 and the CO2 absorbs it and then sends oem it it back down to the ground 
- What is albedo? What is the average Earth albedo? Which surfaces have high albedos?
	- albedo is earths reflection 
	- biggest reflectors are things that are light in color 
		- clouds
		- snow 
		- ice 
		- sand 
	- average is 30 to 31 percet 
- Understand the basics of energy balance on Earth - where is there a surplus and deficit?
	- 30 degrees north and south of equator 
		- More energy coming in than leaving, surplus of energy 
	- polar regions 
		- more earth energy leaving than sunlight coming in 
			- deficit of energy 
	- To counterbalance energy near the equator earth sends warm air towards the poles and cold air to the equator 
	- Why we have warm fronts and cold fronts and hurricanes and giant weather systems
