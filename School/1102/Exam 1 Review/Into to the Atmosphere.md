-  What is weather
	- What is happening outside right now 
	- Current state of atmosphere right now 
- What is climate
	- Long term average of different vairables
		- Temperature 
		- humidity 
		- wind 
	- Average variables over a long term and come up with an average which is your climate 
- What was Earth's early atmosphere made of? Today?
	- Mostly nitrogen 
		- 78%
	- 21% oxygen 
- Know the difference between constant and variable gases and the dominant ones 
	- Constant 
		- Nitrogen 
		- oxygen 
	- Variable
		- Carbon dioxide
		- Water vapor 
			- dominant variable gas
		- Their amounts change from location to locaion 
- Which variable gas is the most important for 'weather' and why?
	-  Water vapor 
		- dominant variable gas
		- water vapor evaporates off the surface water
		- Liquide water does create teh vapor in teh atmosphere which releases heat 
		- When it condenses, it creates clouds, percipitation 
		- All of the fresh water on earth is created by water vapor 
- What have CO2 concentrations done over the past 150 years?
	- they've increased over the last 150 years
	- Burning of fossil fuels 
	- CO2 is a known greenhouse gas
		- it traps in the heat that the Earth would normally let out
		- 
- What is ozone and where is it found? What does 'good' ozone do for us?
	- Found in stratosphere
	- 10 to 15 miles above ground 
	- layer of ozone is 003, naturally occuring 
	- reflects ultraviolet radiation that coming from the sun 
		- Ozone tends to block a good chunk of it 
- What is an aerosol and name some examples
	- Something that is in the atmosphere that is non gaseous
	- Ex
		- Pollen 
			- Floating around 
		- Dust
		- Salt from ocean 
		- Volcanic dust 
		- Saharan dust 
	- Pollutatnts that are non gases 
- Understand the key properties of the virtical structure of the atmosphere: 
	- Density 
		- steadily decreases the higher you go 
		- Becaues gravity points straight down 
		- fewer air molecules higher up 
		- 
	- Pressure
		- steadily decreases the high you go 
	- Temp
		- decreases with height 
- Know the lowest two thermal layers in the atmosphere (Troposphere and Stratosphere) - what does temperature do with height in each?
	- Troposphere 
		- Closest to ground 
		- temp gets colder higher you go 
			- sun mostly heats the ground
	- Stratosphere
		- Temperature increases with height 
		- Ozone layer absorbs ultraviolet radiation 
- What is a geostational satellite? Know the difference between: visible, IR and Water Vapor satellite 
	- as the earth turns, the satellite turns with it. 
	- Covers same spot on earth all the time 
	- Visible 
		- Just a normal picture 
	- Infrared
		- scans for temperature 
		- colder the coulds are the brighter they are 
		- means the taller they are and the stronger they are 
	- Water vapor visible 
		- scans for water vapor 
		- gaseous water
