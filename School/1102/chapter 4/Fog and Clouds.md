Fog usually forms in one of two ways
- Cooling 
	- Air is cooled below its saturation point (dew point)
- Evaporation and mixing 
	- Water vapor is added to the air by evaporation, and the moist air mixes with relatively dry air 

Types of Fog
- Radiation Fog
	- Produced by earth's radiational cooling 
	- Most common 
- Advection fog
	- Warm, moist air moves over a sufficient colder surface; the moist air may cool to its saturation point 
	- Happens near oceans 
- Upslope (mountain) fog
	- Forms as moist air flows up along an elevated plain, hill or mountain 
- Evaportion (mixing) fog:
	- Formed by the mixing of two unsaturated masses of air 
- Steam fog
	- Forms when cold air moves over warm water
- Percipitation (frontal) fog:
	- Develops in the shallow layer of cold air just ahead of an approaching warm front or behind a cold front 

Foggy Weather
- Dense fog
	- Prevalent in costal margins
		- Espically these regions lapped by cold ocean currents and near the Great Lakes and Appalachian Mountains
	- Causes extremely limited visibility 
		- Airports suspend flights

The four major cloud groups and their types 
- High Clouds
	- Cirrostratus (Cs)
	- Cirrus (Ci)
	- Cirrocumulus (Cc)
- Middle Clouds 
	- Altostratus (As)
	- Altocumulusu (Ac)
- Low Clouds
	- Stratus (St)
	- Stratocumulus (Sc)
	- Nimbostratus (Ns)
- Clouds with Vertical Developent 
	- Cumulus (Cu)
	- Cumulonimbus (Cb)

Clouds and Satellite Imagery 
- Weather satellite 
	- Cloud-observing platform in Earth's orbit 
	- Provides extremely valuabe cloud images of areas where they are no ground-based observations 
		- Geostationary satellites orbit the equator at the same rate the earth spins 
		- Polar-orbiting satellites closely parallel Earth's meridian lines
