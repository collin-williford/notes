Water Vapor 
- Transforms into cloud droplets and ice crystals; particles that grow in size and fall to the earth as precipitation 

Humidity 
- amount of water vapor in the air, it is not constant through time or space 

Evaporation 
- Energy from the sun transforms enormous quantities of liquid water into water vapor 

Condensation 
- Water vapor changes back into liquid, forming clouds 

Precipitation 
- Rain, snow or hail 

Evaporation, Condensation and Saturation 
- Evaporation 
	- Molecules changing from liquid to vapor state
- Condensation 
	- Molecules changing from a vapor to liquid state
- Saturation 
	- Total number of molecules escaping from liquid (evaporating) are balanced by the number of number returning (condensing)

- warm air can hold more moisture
	- molecules are spaced farther away allows for more space for water molecules 

Water in the Atmosphere
- Vapor pressure
	- Actual vapor pressure: 
		- partial pressure of water vapor 
	- Saturation vapor pressure
		- amount of water vapor necessary to make the air saturated at any given temperature 

How do we measure how much water is in the air?
- Take all the pressure every molecule is pushing down on you then take out nitrogen, oxygen, etc. till only water molecules left 

Relative Humidity 
- Ratio of water vapor in air to maximum amount of water vapor required for saturation at that particlar temperature (and pressure)
	- Ratio of air's water vapor content to its capacity 
- Changed by vapor content or air temperature 
	- Increased water vapor content increases relative humiditiy 
	- Decreased temperature causes an increase in relative humidity (inverse relationship) 

Relative Humidity and Dewpoint 
- Dewpoint is the temperature at which saturation occurs. This is a good measure of actual water vapor content. The difference between air temperature and dew point can indicate whether the relative humidity is low or high. 

Average dewpoint of Charlotte during the winter?
- 30F

Relative Humidity and Moisture in and out of a Cloud 
- If rain is coming from a cloud the humidiity in the cloud is greater than 100% 

Relative Humidity and Human Discomfort
- When air temperature and relative humidity are high and air is nearly saturated with water vapor, body moisture does not readily evaporate; it collects on skin as perspiration 
- Wet bulb temperature: 
	- lowest temperature reached by evaporating water into the air 
- Heat index: 
	- combines air temperature with relative humidity to determine apparent temperature 

Measuring Humidity 
- Psychometer
	- two liquid-in-glass thermometers mounter side by side and attached to a piece of metal that has either a hand or chain at one end 
	- if two temps are same = 100% humidity 
	- larger difference means low humidity 
	- smaller difference means high humidity 
- Hygrometer
	- Hair hygrometer, electrical hygrometer, and dew-point hygrometer

Dew and Frost
- Dew forms on objects near the ground surface when they cool below the dew point. It is more likely on clear nights 
- White frost forms when the dew-point temperature is at or below freezing. it forms on cold, clear, calm mornings
