Thunderstorms 
- Multicell Thunderstorms 
	- These storms contain a number of cells, each in a different stage of development 
	- They form in a region of moderate-to-strong vertical wind speed shear 
- Gust fronts and Microburts
	- These come from the leading edge of the cold outflowing air 
	- The winds that typically come before a thunderstorm begins 
	- If a gust front becomes strong enough, they can become micro-burts (downpour)
		- Micro-burts are downburts with winds extending 4km or less 

Squal-line Thunderstorms  
- Line of multicell thunderstorms 
	- Pre-frontal squall-line 
	- Bow echo 
	- Derecho 
- Mesoscale convective complex 
	- A number of individual multicell thunderstorms grow in size and organize into a large circular convective weather system 

Supercell thunderstorms 
- Strong vertical wind shear 
- Long-lasting thunderstorms with single violently rotating updraft 

What causes thunderstorms to become electrified?
- Collisions between big ice partical and tiny ice crystals help to seperate charges in the cloud 

Why are positive strikes considered stronger and deadlier than negative strikes?
- Positive strikes occur farther away from the ground, allowing larger charge to build up 

What causes the sound of thunder in a thunderstorm?
- Expansion and compression of air due to the heat of lightning
