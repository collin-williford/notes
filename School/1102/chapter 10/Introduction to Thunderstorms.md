Charactersitics of a Thunderstorm 
- A storm that contains lightning and thunder 
- They are convective storms that form with rising air 
- There are serveral triggers such as: 
	- Turbulent eddies
	- Unequal surface heating, terrain, fronts, etc. 
- Severe thunderstorms can produce large hail (>1" diameter), wind gusts greater than or equal to 50 knots, or a tornado

Ordinary Cell Thunderstorms 
- These are air-mass thunderstorms that tend to form where the wind speed and wind direction do not abruptly change with increasing height 

Three stages of ordinary cell thunderstorm development 
- Cumulus stage 
	- Updraft of warm air 
- Mature Stage 
	- Warm air rising with cold air sinking 
- Dissipating Stage 
	- Warm air is at very top and cold air continues to sink 
	- Takes 45 min to 1 hour from Cumulus stage to Dissipating Stage 

Why are thunderstorms more common in the southeastern United States than they are on the west coast?
- The southeastern United States is affected by the Gulf of Mexico, which enhances the supply of warm, moist air and supports thunderstorm formation
