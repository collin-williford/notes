What is Flash Flooding?
- Flash Flooding is flooding that occurs gradually over time due to continuous rain 
- Flash flooding occurs when thunderstorms produce a large amount of rain in a short amount of time 
- Flash flooding is the deadliest phenomenon associated with thunderstorms 

Mudslides
- Mudslides can occur as a result of flash flooding. They occur in high terrain areas in which steep slops cause water to move quickly. The water then picks up mud, resulting in destructive muddy slides 

Which specific types of Thunderstorms are known to generate flash flooding?
- Stationary thunderstorms 
- Training thunderstorms 

Hail 
- Hail is another destructive aspect of thunderstorms that causes property damage
- Hail forms in nearly every thunderstorm, but rarely reaches the ground. This is because hail is rarely large enough to make it to the surface before it evaporates 

What kind of updrafts are needed to produce large hail?
- Golfball size hail 
	- 55-60 mph updrafts
- Softball size hail 
	- 100 mph updrafts 

Which of the following best defines severe hail?
- Hailstones with a diameter of one inch or larger, capable of damaging car windshilds and roofs 

Tornadoes 
- What is a tornado
	- A tornado is rapidly rotating column of air. It blows around a small area of intense low pressure with circulation that reaches the ground 
- What are the life cycle stages of a tornado?
	- 1. Dust-whirl stage
	- 2. Mature stage 
	- 3. Decay stage 

What are the two named areas in the United States where tornadoes most often occur?
- Tornado Alley 
- Dixie Alley 

The Fujita Scale 
- The Fujita Scale classifies tornadoes according to rotational wind speed 
- Enhanced Fujita Scale 
	- Attempts to provide a wide range of criteria in estimating a tornado's winds yb usign a set of 28 damage indicators 

Tornado Alert Stages
- Tornado Watch
	- Tornadoes are likely to form during the next few hours 
- Tornado warning 
	- Tornado is spotted either visually or on a radar 
- Tornado emergency 
	- Strong tornado threatens a populated area 

What does VORTEX stand for?
- Vertification of the Origin of Rotational Tornadoes Experiment
