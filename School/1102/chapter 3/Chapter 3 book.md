Daily temperature Variations
- The daily range of temperature decreases as we climb away form Earth's surface. Hence, there is less day-to-night variation in air temperature near the top of a high-rise apartment complex than at the ground level
- Clouds tend to keep daytime temperatures lower and nighttime temperatures, higher, producing a small daily range in temperature. In the absence of clouds, days tend to be warmer and nights cooler, producing a larger daily range in temperature
