Why Earth has seasons
- Seasons are regulated by the amount of solar energy 
- Solar energy at Earth's surface depends on angle of light received and how long it receives it 
	- Direct solar energy leads to more heat - What does direct actually mean?
- The distance light travels through earth's atmosphere matters?
- Aphelion
	- Earth is furthest from the Sun 
- Perihelion
	- Earth is closest to the Sun
