- Highest Air temperature 
	- 57C (134F) death valley, California 
- Hottest place on earth 
	- Dallol, Ethiopia has an average daily maximum temp of 38C (100F)
- Lowest Air Temperature 
	- -89C (-129F) Vostok, Antarctica
- Coldest Place on Earth 
	- South Pole (9000 ft) with average temp -46C (-51F)

 - Desert regions are often the hottest places on Earth because they lack clouds

Main controllers of daily temperatures
- Latitude 
	- biggest factor 
- Land and water distributions
- Ocean currents 
- Elevation 

Continential vs Marine Effect
- Continental 
	- really hot in summer and cold in winter 
	- doesn't matter the waters temp 
	- Ex:
		- Richmond, VA
- Marine 
	- A cities temperatures is controlled by the temp of ocean 
	- Ex: 
		- Seattle 
		- San Fran 

Urban Heat Island 
- Cities, on average are warmer than their surrounding rural enviroments 
	- Buildings block wind 
	- pavement, concrete absorb more heat 
	- pollution trap more heat 

Applications of Air Temperature Data 
- Heating degree day 
	- An index for fuel consumption 
	- Assumes furnace use when mean daily temp drops below 65F
