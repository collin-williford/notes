Air Temperature and Human Comfort 
- Humans body temp
	- Stabilized through metabolism 
	- Radiant energy is absorbed and emitted
	- Heat is lost and gained by conduction and convection 
- Sensible temperature: preceived temp 
	- Often higher or lower than actual temp 
- Wind-chill index (WCI) - how cold it 'feels'

How we measure temperature
- Types of thermometers
	- Liquin-in-glass thermometer
		- tube with alcohol or mercury inside glass, used for surface air temperature
	- Maximum thermometer
		- Generally a tube with murcury, measures highest temperature
	- Minimum thermometer
		- Generally alcohol as the liquid, measures lowest temperature 

Thermograph 
- measures records and temperature
- Intrument shelter provides instruments protection from wind, rain, snow
