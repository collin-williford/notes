Daily Warming and Cooling Air Near the Surface
- Earth receives the most intense solar rays at noon 
- maximum daytime temp is 3pm to 5pm on cloud free days
- There is a lag between maximum solar heating and maximum air temperature 
- What happens at night?
- Heat energy at the grounds surface is dissipated
- Ground and air cool by radiational cooling creating a radiation inversion 
	- Air above surface is warmer than the ground 
	- An inversion is created 
- Radiation inverstions
	- Stronger on clear, long, windless and dry nights
	- Top of the inversion: 100m in middle latitudes and 1000m in polar regions 

Can you have frost at night when it's above freezing 
- yes the temperature measured is 1.5 meters above ground so that allows the temp closer to the ground to be colder
