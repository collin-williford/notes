Major Pollutants 
- Primary Pollutants 
	- Directly emitted form human activities, including vehicles, factories, and power plants 
	- Examples
		- Carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds, and ozone 
- Secondary Pollutants 
	- Secondary pollutants form through chemical reactions between primary pollutants and atmospheric components 
	- Example 
		- O^3 is a secondary pollutant formed through reactsions involving nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds 

Carbon Monoxide 
- Colorless, odorless gas from volcanic eruptions, forest fires, bacterial activities and fuel combustion 

Particulates 
- Particulates are aerosols, suspending solid or liquid particles 
- The smaller the particulate the more dangeroud it is 
- Effects of particulates 
	- Reduced visibility and health concerns 
	- PM(10) enters lungs, PM(2.5) even more dangeroud 

Ozone 
- Stratospheric ozone is formed naturally through the interaction of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation with molecular oxygen 
- Ozone in the troposphere 
	- Smog origionally meant the combining of smoke and fog; but now smog mainly refers to smog in large cities 
- The main component of photochemical smog is ozone (bad ozone)
- Ozone is the stratosphere is known as good ozone 
	- It blocks out the harmful radiation from the sun 

The risks of ozone depletion 
- An increase in skin cancer amongst humans 
- An increase in eye cataracts and sunburn 
- The supression of the immune system 
- An adverse impact on crops and animals due to increased ultraviolet radiation 
- A reduction in the growth of ocean phytoplankton
