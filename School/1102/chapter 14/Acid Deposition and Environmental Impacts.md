Acid Deposition 
- Deposition refers to the process by which atmospheric particles, such as water vapor, transform directly from a gas to a solid form on surfaces, bypassing the liquid phase. This can occur when air temperature drops and reaches the dew point, causing water vapor to condense and freeze onto surfaces as frost, ice or snow.

Dry deposition 
- Particles and gases slowly settle to the ground in dry form 
Wet deposition 
- Particles are removed from the air during formation of cloud particles and then carried to the ground in rain and snow 
Acid deposition 
- Both dry and wet acidic substances 

What is natural Acid Rain 
- Natural Acid rain has a peak of about 5.6 ph 
- Once a raindrop encounters a CO2 molecule and the molecule is inside the water, it becomes carbonic acid 

What is man-made Acid Rain?
- Man made Acid Rain occurs when the value is less than 5.6

Acid rain can be worse in different areas of the country 

Environmental Impacts 
- Acid rain and fog can cause tremendous damage to the enviroment 
	- Depends on what the groundwater streams, systems, and soild is made of; naturally based material in the ground neutralizes the acid 
- Limestone structures are particularly vulnerable
- Primary damage is done to the hydrologic system 
- In the eastern U.S., around 1,200 lakes are void of life because acidification 
- In Ontario, Canada, around 6,500 lakes are uninhabitable
- Fifty of the largest power generating plants in the US accounts for 50% of all the eastern US acid deposition
