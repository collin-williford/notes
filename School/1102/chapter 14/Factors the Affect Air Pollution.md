Wind 
- The role of wind 
	- Dispersion: strong winds tend to lower the concentration of pollutants by spreading them apart as they move downward 
- The role of stability and inversions 
	- Vertical mixing 
	- Radiation inversion 
	- Mixing layers and depths

- Smokestacks are used to redirect pollution from the ground into the air 
- It is to get the pollution away from the air that we are breathing 
- The higher the smokestack, the faster the wind blows and the faster the smoke is able to move through the atmosphere. This allows the pollution to disperse at a faster rate 

The role of topography 
- Valleys prone to pollution are completely encased by mountains or hills 
- Air pollution concentrations in mountain valleys tend to be greatest during the colder months 
	- More cold air gets stuck in the valley, so when you pollute into that, it can't go anywhere again 
- Pollution problems in several large cities is, at least, partly due to topography 

Severe air pollution potential: ingredients 
- Many sources of pollution 
- Stationary deep high-pressure areas 
- Light surface winds 
- Subsidence inversion 
- Shallow mixing layer 
- Valleys 
- Clear night skies 
- Smog 

Air Pollution and the Urban Environment 
- Urban Heat Island 
	- A region of city warmth 
		- Strongest at night, during winter, and when the region is dominated by high-pressure area with light winds, clear skies, and less humid air 
- Country Breeze 
	- Light breeze that blows from the countrysize into the city 
		- Espically likely if an inversion inhibits vertical mixing and dispersion 

Areas of high pressure have higher pollution levels
