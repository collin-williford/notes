Scales of Motion:
- Microscale
	- Defined as the smallest scale of motion 
	- Examples include swirling leaves or small eddies, typically a few feet across 
	- Brief duration, such as leaves swirling for a few seconds or minute
- Mesoscale
	- Larger than microscale 
	- Illustrations include local phenomena like rain showers or thunderstorms 
	- Spans a few miles, affecting small regions like a campus or a city 
- Macroscale
	- Encompasses larger weather systems 
	- Impacts a broader area, such as half of a state 
	- Examples include lines of thunderstorms or hurricanes covering several hundred miles 
- Synoptic Scale 
	- Refers to even larger weather systems 
	- Covers extensive regions, such as half a continent 
	- Occurs over distances of 500 to 1500 miles 
	- Notable for systems like cold fronts spanning from North Dakota to Texas 
- Global (Planetary) Scale 
	- The largest scale of motion 
	- Involves immense atmospheric phenomena, like the jet stream and Hadley cells 
	- Spans the entire planet, affecting global circulation patterns 

Eddies - Big and Small 
- Eddy: whirl of air 
	- When wind encounters a solid object, a whirl of air forms on the object's downwind side 
		- Size and shape often depend upon size and shape of the obstacle and on wind speed 
		- Types; rotors, mountain wave eddy, and turbulent
