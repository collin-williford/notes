Large Scale
- General circulation of the atmosphere 
	- Winds throughout the world are averaged over a long period of time 
		- Actual winds may vary considerably from this average 
		- Underlying cause of the general circulation is the unequal heating of Earth's surface 
- Several centries ago, early meterologists formulated the concept of the single cell model of Earth's circulation. In this model:
	- The equator is depicted as a region of high temperature where warm air rises 
	- The rising warm air spreads out towards the North and South Poles 
	- As the poles, colder air is present, which then sinks back towards the equator 
	- This forms a large, singular circulation pattern with air ascending in the tropics, traveling towards the poles, sinking at the poles, and returning southward towards the equator 

Single Cell Model - What we used to think 
- We assume that the 
	- Earth's surface is uniformly covered with water
	- Sun is always directly overhead the equator 
	- Earth does not rotate 
- Result 
	- Huge thermally direct convection cell 
		- Hadley Cell 

Three Cell Model 
- Earth is allowed to spin 
- Simple convection system breaks into a series of cells 
- Land masses complicate the overall flow through 

Where does the ITCZ shift?
- Average surface wind and pressure: the real world 
	- Semi-permanent highs and lows move on only slightly during the course of a year 
	- Northern and Southern hemispheres contrast 
		- Our summer (Northern Hemisphere) is at a different time than summer in the Southern Hemisphere; it's cooler there when it is warmer here 
	- Major pressure systems, wind belts, and ITCZ shift seasonally with the high sun
		- North in July and south in January 
- The ITCZ also impacts rainfall patterns in each hemisphere
	- During the Northern hemisphere's summer, there is low pressure and low concentration of clouds and precipitation 
	- During winter in the Southeast Asia (southern hemisphere; our winter) the ITCZ covers the region, bringing heavy rain. In their winter (our summer), the ITCZ shifts southward over the Indian Ocean, leading to a dry season 

Moonsoons 
- Monsoons are pronounced in areas where the ITCZ shifts significantly between seasons 
- In monsoonal areas, there are significant shifts between wet and dry seasons. Rainforest regions experience consistent rain, while monsoonal areas experience distinct wet and dry periods
	- Blows from one direction in the summer and from the opposite direction in the winter 
	- In eastern and southern Asia, the winter monsoon, which blows from land to water, is dry; the summer monsoon, which blows from water to land is wet

Where would you expect the precipitation?
- Global circulation and precipitation patterns 
	- Global scale:
		- abundant rainfall where air rises and very little where the air sinks 
- Westerly winds and the jet stream 
	- Jet stream 
		- rivers of fast-flowing air where upper-level winds tend to concentrate into narrow bands
