- Global wind patterns and surface ocean currents 
	- Wind blows over the oceans and causes the surface water to drift along with it 
		- Creates pressure differences 
	- Gulf stream 
		- warm water current flowing northward along the east coast of the United States 
	- High pressure system over the Atlantic known as the Bermuda high. Its clockwise flow influences surrounding air movement 
	- Air circulation around the Bermuda high drives ocean water circulation, causing it to move across the surface in a circular pattern 
	- High-pressure system over the Pacific, similar clockwise flow, leading to ocean circulation 
	- These air and ocean circulations transport warm water from the Caribbean and southern Atlantic towards Europe, maintaining warmth, while also moving cold water southward, helping balance Earth's temperature 

- Winds and upwelling
	- Upwelling: 
		- Rising of cold water from below 
			- Wind must flow more or less parallel to the coastline 
- El Nino, La Nina, and Southern Oscillation 
	- El Nino
		- War water episode 
	- La Nina 
		- Cold-water episode 
	- Southern Oscillation 
		- Seesaw pattern if reversing surface air pressure at opposite ends of the Pacific Ocean 

Atmosphere-Ocean Interactions 
- As winds blow parallel to the west coast of North America, surface water is transported to the right (out to sea). Cold water moves from below (upwells) to replace the surface water.
