Not Every Wind is Global 
- Thermal circulation 
	- Circulations brought on by changes in air temperature, in which warmer air rises and colder air sinks 
- Thermal highs and lows 
	- Regions of surface atmospheric pressure created as the atmosphere either cools or warms 

Sea and Land Breezes
- Warm air is less dense and exerts lower pressure. In contrast, colder air is denser and creates higher pressure. The temperature difference between the land and ocean reults in different pressure areas 
- The warmer land creates a lower pressure area, while the ocean, being cooler, has higher pressure. This pressure difference causes air to flow from the ocean towards the land, resulting in onshore winds 
- The onshore winds observed at the beach during hot afternoons are known as sea breezes. As the land heats up, the pressure difference intensifies, causing the sea breeze to pick up speed throughout the afternoon. 
- At night, land cools off rapidly, becoming cooler than the ocean. The ocean now has higher pressure due to its relatively warmer temperature. This setup leads to offshore winds, blowing from the land towards the ocean. This is Land Breeze 
- The daytime sea breeze is characterized by onshore winds from the ocean to the land, while the nighttime land breeze is marked by offshore winds from the land to the ocean 
- The sea breeze phenomenon is a daily occurance at many beaches. In the morning, winds are winds are calm, but as the land heats up during the day, sea breezes develop and become stronger 

Other Local Wind Systems 
- Mountain and Valley Breezes 
	- Valley Breeze
		- During the day, the sun heats the valley slopes faster than teh surrounding mountains. Warm air rises up the slopes, creating a valley breeze that ascends
	- Mountain Breeze 
		- At night, the valley cools down rapidly, causing the mountain slopes to become cooler than the air above. This leads to a mountain breeze, where denser cold air descends from the mountains into the valley
- Katabatic Winds 
	- Also known as drainage winds, kabatic winds are cold, dense air currents that flow downhill due to gravity. They are typicaly formed at night when the highlands cool down, causing the air to sink and flow into lower elevations 
- Chinook (Foehn) Winds 
	- Chinook winds occur on the lee side of a mountain range. Moist air from the windward side rises and cools as it ascends the mountain, causing precipitation. As the air descends on the leeward side, it warms and dries, creating strong and warm Chinook winds 
- Santa Ana Winds 
	- Dry, warm winds that occur in Southern California. They are causing by high-pressure systems over the Great Basin. As Air descends from the Great Basin to the coastal region, it heats up and dries out, increasing the risk of wildfires 
- Desert Winds
	- Such as the Siroco in Northern Africa or the Harmattan in West Africa, are dry and dusty winds that blow over desert regions. They can carry sand and dust over long distances, affecting visibility and air quality
