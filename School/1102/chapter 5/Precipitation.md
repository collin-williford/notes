- Any form of water (liquid or solid) that falls from a cloud and reaches the ground is known as precipitation 
- Clouds are composed of many droplets that grow through condensation 

Collision, coalescence, and the ice-crystal process
- Collision and Coalescence
	- Large droplets overtake and collide with smaller drops is their path (i.e., collision). The merging of cloud droplets by collision is called coalescence
- Ice-Crystal Process
	- Both ice crystals and liquid cloud droplets are present in clouds at temperatures below freezing 

Precipitation in Clouds
- Precipitation may begin only minutes after the cloud forms. It is initiated by either the collision-coalescense or the ice-crystal (Bergeron) process. Most growth is by accretion; supercooled liquid droplets freeze on impact with snowflakes and ice crystals

Rain
- Falling drop of liquid water
	- Drizzle: Less than 0.5 mm
	- Virga: Evaporation streaks of percipitation 
	- Cloudburst: Excessively heavy shower

Snow 
- Frozen water falling from the sky 
- Most precipitation starts as snow. Some important concepts are freezing level, appearance, fall streaks, flurries, snow squall, thundersnow, and blizzard 

Snowfall description
- Light
	- Visibility 
		- Greater than 1/2 mile
- Moderate
	- Visibility 
		- Greater then 1/4 mile, less than or equal to 1/2 mile
- Heavy 
	- Visibility 
		- less than or equal to 1/4 mile 

Precipitation Types 
- Sleet and freezing rain 
	- Sleet
		- Tiny transparet (or translucent) ice pellet that forms when a partially melted snowflake or cold raindrop turns back into ice when it falls through the deep subfreezing surface layer of air
		- snowflake -> snowflake melts -> raindrop -> raindrop freezes -> sleet
	- Freezing rain 
		- Then veneer of ice that forms as raindrops hit a cold object 
		- rain that then freezes when its on the ground
- Snow gains and snow pellets
	- Snow Grains
		- Solid equivalent of drizzle
		- neither bounce nor shatter
	- Snow pellets
		- White, opaque grains of ice about the size of an average raindrop
			- Bounce, brittle, and crunchy 
	- Graupel
		- Ice particle accumulation with rime 
	- Hail 
		- Pieces of ice, tranparent of partially opaque, ranging in size from that of small peas to that of golf balls or larger 

Measuring Precipitation 
- Instrumets 
	- Rain guage: 
		- Standard, tipping bucket, and weighting-type 
- Doppler radar and precipitation 
	- Radar
		- Transmitter generates energy toward target and returned energy is measured and displayed 
			- Brightness of echo
				- amount/intensity of rain 
	- Doppler
		- Measures speed of horizontal rain
