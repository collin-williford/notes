- Clouds release heat to the atmosphere, regulate Earth's energy balance, and indicate physical processes taking place in the atmosphere

How Clouds are Formed
- What happens to air when it rises?
	- A bubble of air which has high pressure because it started at the ground will move up then the lower pressure air above will cause the bubble to expand using energy, which causes temperature to go down 

Atmospheric Stability 
- Clouds form as air rises and cools
	- Atmospheric stability 
		- state of equalibrium
	- Adiabatic process
		- Parcel of air expands and cools, or compresses and warms, with no interchange of heat with its outside surroundings
		- If temp is same as dew point 
			- Dry rate: 10C / per 1000 m
			- Moist rate: 6C / per 1000 m

In an unstable atmosphere, air parcels will continue to rise on their own, while in a stable atmosphere, air parcels tend to resist vertical movement
- True

Determining Stability 
- Stable Air
	- Rising air is colder than its environment and sinks
- Unstable Air
	- Warm air continues to rise until it reaches the same temperature as its environment 

Cloud Development and Stability 
- Mechanisms responsible for cloud development 
	- Surface heating and free convection 
	- uplife along topography
	- Widespread ascent due to the flowing together (convergence) of surface air
	- Uplife along weather fronts
