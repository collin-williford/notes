- Air Masses
	- Extremely large body of air whose temperature and humidity are similar hoizontally and vertically 
- Source Region 
	- Area where air mass originates; generally flat and uniform composition with light surface winds 

Air masses are generally very large 

Classifying Air masses
- Air mass claassification is based upon temperature and humidity 
- Air masses are generally labelled as 'm' for maritime or 'c' for continental, based on the location they are coming from (in the ocean or on a continent)
- Air masses are then labled with 'P' for polar or 'T' for tropical, based on being hot or cold. There is also a label for a very cold air mass of continental artic as "cA"
