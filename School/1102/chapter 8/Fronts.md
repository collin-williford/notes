- Front 
	- Transition zone between two air masses of different densities
- Stationary Front 
	- Front with essentially no movement 
	- Winds tend to blow in parallel but opposite directions 
- Cold front 
	- Cold, dry, stable polar air replaces warm, moist, unstable subtropical air 
- Warm front 
	- Warm, moist subtropical air from the Gulf of Mexico replace cold, maritime polar air from the North Atlantic 
- Occluded front 
	- Frontal boundary created between two air masses when a cold front catches up to and overtakes a warm front 

The type of fronts Charlotte typically experiences are called Polar fronts, because Charlotte is located in a mT zone 

Cold Front 
- When cold, dry, stable polar air replaces warm, moist, unstable subtropical air 
	- Back door cold front 
		- fronts that move in from the east or northeast 

Warm Front 
- Warm, moist subtropical air from the Gulf of Mexico replace cold, maritime polar air from the North Atlantic 
	- Overrunning: 
		- Rising of warm air over cold 
	- Dry lines 
		- Dry air along a boundary; dew-point temperatures may drop along this boundary by as much as 10c per kilometer 

Occluded Front 
- Frontal boundary created between two air masses when a cold front catches up to, and overtakes a warm front 
	- Cold occlusion 
		- Air behind occluded front is colder than air ahead of it
