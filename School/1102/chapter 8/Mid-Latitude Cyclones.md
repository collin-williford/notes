Polar Front Theory 
- A polar front is a semicontinuous global boundary separating cold polar air from warm subtropical air 
- Wave cyclones form and move along a polar front in a wavelike manner 
- Front wave forms under the right conditions in a wavelike link 

Formation of Mid-Lat Cyclones 
- Air piling up is convergence 
- Air spreading is divergence 

The polar jet stream removes air above the surface cyclonic storm and supplies air to the surface anticyclone 
- Upper-air support
	- Vertical and horizontal motions sufficient to enhance cyclonic storm development 

What is the primary cause of mid-latitude cyclonic storm formation?
- interaction between warm and cold air masses
