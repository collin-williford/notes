Coriolis Force
- Apparent force due to rotation of Earth
	- Right of intended path in Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern hemisphere
	- The stronger the wind, the greater the deflection 
	- Amount of deflection depends on the earth's rotation, latitude, and object's speed
	- Acts at right angles to the wind 

Pressure and Coriolis together 
- Straight-line flow aloft
	- Geostropic wind cna be estimated directly by observing the orientation of the isobars on an upper-level chart 
		- When the flow of air is purely geostropic the isobars (or contour liens) are straight and evenly spaced adn the wind speed is constant 
		- Geostropic wind blows parallel to isobars
- Curved winds around lows and highs aloft 
	- Cyclonic 
		- Counterclockwise flow of air around a low 
	- Anticyclonic
		- Clockwise flow of air around a high 
- Winds on upper-level charts 
	- Winds tend to be parallel to contour lines and flow west-to-east
- Surface winds - Friction must be included
	- Winds cross the isobars at about 30 degrees
	- Friction reduces the wind speed which in turn decreases the Coriolis effect 

Friction only allows for a slight turn to the right. Thus, the wind crosses the pressure lines
