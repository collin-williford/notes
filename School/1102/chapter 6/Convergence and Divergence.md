Winds and Vertical Air Motions
- Air moves inward toward the center of a low-pressure area
	- Converging air cannot go into the ground, so it slowly rises
		- Above the surface below, the air begins to spread apart (diverge) to compensate with downward force of gravity 

What kind of weather activity is seen in Convergence and Divergence?
- Convergence
	- Cloud Formation 
	- Percipitation 
	- Thunderstorms 
	- Low-Pressure Systems 
- Divergence 
	- Clear Skies 
	- Dry Conditions 
	- High-Pressure Systems 
	- Temperature Fluctuations 

Aloft where horizontal variations in temperature exist, there is a corresponding horizontal change in pressure
- Once air is set in motion, the Coriolis force bends the moving air 
- Interaction of the forces causes the wind to blow in different directions
- Various methods and instruments are used to measure wind speed and direction
