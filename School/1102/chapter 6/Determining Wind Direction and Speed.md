Why the Wind Blows
- Forces that influence the wind
	- Pressure gradient: 
		- steep or gentile
	- Pressure gradient force:
		- net force on the air when differences in horizontal air pressure exist 
			- Always points from Higher to Lower presure 

Wind Direction and Speed
- Wind is characterized by direction, speed, and gustiness
	- Wind direction describes the direction from which it is blowing 
		- Onshore
		- Offshore 
		- Upslope
		- Downslope 

The importance of Wind Direction 
- Wind direction is defined by the direction from which the wind is coming. For incatnce, winds moving from north to south are termed northerly winds
- Meterologist focus on the direction of incoming weather systems because it determiens the impact on a particular region. 
- Wind direction is often representd by flags; the direction in which a flag points signifies the wind's source
- The length and number of flag segments provide infromation about wind speed
- Wind barbs are graphic respresentations used on weather maps to convey wind direction and speed

The influence of prevaling winds
- Prevaling wind: wind direction most often observed during a given time period 
	- Can greatly affect the climate of a region 
	- Upslope: rising, cooling air makes clouds, fog, and precipitation more likely than where the winds are downslope
