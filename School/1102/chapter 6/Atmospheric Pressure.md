- Air pressure is the mass of air above a given level - think of it as weight
	- As we climb in altitude above Earth's surface, there are fewer air molecules above us 
		- Atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing weight 
	- Our atmosphere is highly compressible
		- Most of it is squeezed close to Earth's surface
			- Causes air pressure to decrease with height, rapidly at first, then more slowly at higher altitudes 
- What is the difference between the vertical and horizontal pressure differences?
- Which is stronger?
- How does this create wind?

- Measuring air pressure (i.e., force exerted by the air molecules over a given area)
	- Barometer:
		- measures bars
			- unit of pressure that describes a force over a given area
		- Barometric pressure or standard atmospheric pressure 
			- 1013.25mb
		- Aneroid barmeters:
			- Most common home barometer; contain no fluid
