 - Frame header/trailer include information for 
	 - Error detection and/or Error correction 

Error Detection
 - Include information that allows receiver to detect errors
 - If error, receiver can request re-transmission of data 
 - Error detecting codes
	 - Parity 
	 - Checksum
	 - Cyclic redundancy check
- Useful for transmission media where errors are rare

Error Correction
 - Include information that allows receiver to detect and correct errors 
 - Error correcting codes
	 - Hamming code
	 - Reed-Solomon code
- Useful for transmission media where errors occur often
