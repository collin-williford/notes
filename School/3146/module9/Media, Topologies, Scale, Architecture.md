Who are the actors involved?
 - Source or sender \[host/end system]
	 - Generates data to be transmitted
- Transmitter \[Network Interface Card]
	- Converts data into transmittable forms (signals)
- Communication medium
	- Carries data (in the form of signals)
- Receiver \[router/switch]
	- Converts signals into data
- Destination or receiver \[host/end system]
	- Receives data

Medium of communication
 - Networks may use differnet communication media
	 - Wired network
		 - Co-axial cables, fiber-optic cables, etc
	- Wireless network
		- Wifi, bluetooth, etc.

Who is connected to whom?
 - Every computer can directly communicate with every other computer
	 - Mesh topology
		 - Each computer connected to every other computer
	- Bus topology
		- All computers connected to common bus
- We can always get to a computer via another
	- Ring topology
		- Each computer connected to two neighbors
	- Star topology
		- Computers connected to central hub/computer through spokes
	- Extended star (tree) topology
		- Improves scalability of star topology

How large is a computer network?
 - Network scale can vary
	 - Within 1 square meter or so 
		 - Personal Area Network (PAN)
	- Within room, building or single campus 
		- Local Area Network (LAN)
	- City wide
		- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
	- Country or continent wide and beyond 
		- Wide Area Network (WAN)

Network architecture/model
 - Central computer provides services and resources
 - Other computers request for services and resources
 - -> Client-server model (e.g., online banking)
 - All computers in network are equal ... no hierarchy
 -  -> Peer-to-peer model (e.g., BitTorrent)
 -
