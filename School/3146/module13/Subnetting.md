 IP address
  - Public IP addresses are allocated and managed hierarchically 
	  - IANA delegates blocks of addresses to regional authoriries (RIR)
	  - ISPs/organizations get blocks of addresses from RIRs
	  - ISPs/organizations assign addresses to customers/computers
- IP addresses are allocated in contiguous blocks called prefixes

	- Most significant L bits form prefix or network address
	- (32 - L) bits identify host within network or subnet
		- There are 2^(32-L) - 1 hosts in subnet 
- Prefix representation 
	- /prefix length in bits -> E.g., /24 for 24-bit prefix 
- Network of computers can be represented using 
	- Start address within network/length of prefix in bits
		- E.g., 172.16.0.0./24
			- Least significant 8 bits form host identifier 
			- Address range is 172.16.0.0 to 172.16.0.255

Subnetting 
 - Organizations can partition their own block of addresses
	 - Create smaller subnets within their assigned subnet 
- E.g., consider a university network 128.208.0.0/16
	- EE.: 1000000 11010000 00| xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx
	- CS: 1000000 11010000 1 | xxxxxx xxxxxxxx
	- Art: 1000000 11010000 011 | xxxxx xxxxxxxx
- Shorter prefix 
	- Larger block of IP addresses with same prefix 
	- Less specific prefix
- Longer prefix 
	- Smaller block of IP addresses with same prefix 
	- More specific prefix
