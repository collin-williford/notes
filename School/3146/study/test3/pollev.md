 - No

When using static partitions, protection can be enforced by storing the base addresses of the partitions 
 - Sometimes true 

Internal fragmentation can occur when using which of the following?
 1. Static partitions of equal size
 2. Static partitions of unequal size 
 3. Dynamic partition of variable size 
 - 1 & 2 

The first fit policy for partition placement in dynamically partition memory suffers from 
 - External fragmentation 

The worst fit parition placement policy scans the entire free list even if it finds a space that is large enough to accommodate the partition being allocated before scanning teh entire free list 
 - True

The next fit partition pacement policy always statrs scanning the free list from the first entry 
 - False

 - Logical address space is divided into pages 

Assume we have main memory of size 64 bytes. Assume this is divided into page frames of size 16 butes each. How many page frames do we have?
 - 2^2

The address issued by a process is divided into 
 - Logical page number + offset within page 

Address translation in a paged memory system refers to 
 - Converting the relative address issued by a process into an absolute whtin the main memory 
 - Converting the logical address issued by a process into a physical address within
