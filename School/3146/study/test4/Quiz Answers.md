- In a **client-server** model a central computer is a provider of services and resources and other computers are consumers of those services and resrouces. In a **peer-to-peer** model computers can be both providers and consumers of data or services
- Each layer in a network software **abstracts** a set of services, which means underlying details are hidden to other layers

	- False
- In a layered approach, a given layer could change individual **protocols** without affecting other layers.

10-1
 - The Open Systems Interconnected (OSI) model specifies the **function** of each layer, but does not specify what **protocols** each layer will use
 - Match the OSI layer with its responsibility 
	 - Application layer
		 - Handles the user interfaces to networking devices
	- Presentation layer
		- Handles formatting the details for the data
	- Session Layer
		- Handles the initiation, maintance and termination of the connection
	- Transportation 
		- Handles the transfer of messages between the sender and receiver 
	- Network Layer
		- Handles the path or rout between source and destination through the network
	- Data Link Layer
		- Handles the transmission of data between two nodes
	- Physical layer
		- Handles the transmission of raw bits over the communication channel 
- Unlike the OSI Model, **protocols** are specifed and are part of the TCP/IP reference model
- In the TCP/IP model, the **applicaiton** layer covers the same functionality as the application, presentation, and session layers in the OSI model. The internet layer in the TCP/IP model corresponds with the **network** layer in the OSI model. The **link** layer in the TCP/IP model corresponds with the data link and physical layers in the OSI model

		- IP
	- Data Link Layer
		- Ethernet 
	- Physical Layer
		- Cat5 Cable 
- The Statistics -> Protocol Hierarchy menue item will give you the layout of all the different **protocols** found by wireshark
- In Wireshark, you can see that frame corresponds to the **physical** layer and you will be able to similarly see how different protocols correspond to different layers in the OSI model.

11-1
 - In a reliable network service, the sender requires an acknowledge ment from the receiver. True or False
	 - True
- The link layer deals with 
	- Logical units of data
- What does it mean when we say that the receiver knows how to de-stuff the received bytes?
	- The receiver ignores escape bytes inserted when the flag byte occurs in the payload
- In bit stuffing, each data frame starts and ends with a special **sequence** of **bits**
- Match the given enviroment with the error control approach that should be used with it
	- Media that is not error prone (optical fiber) 
		- Error detecting codes
	- Media that is error prone (wireless links)
		- Error correcting codes
- Hamming code and Reed-Solomon code are examples of **error correcting codes**
- Which value (or field) in the IP header (layer-3) is used to prevent accidental routing loops?
	- Time to Live
- The source address field in the TCP IP header contains the **IP** address of the original **sender** of the **packet**.
- The **ACK** flag is set to 1 in the TCP IP header to indicate that the value in the Acknowledgment number field is the next sequence number that the receiver is expecting 
- The **FIN** flag is set to 1 in the TCP IP header to indicate that the sender has no more data to send

11-2
 - Most applications use an IP address, which is a **logical** address to send/receive messages, but the actual communication happens over a MAC address, which is a **Physical** address
 - ARP stands for Address **Resolution** Protocol
 - Nodes or systems keeps an ARP **table** or "cache" to store a mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses
 - When an IP address is not found in the ARP cache of a system, the system needs to initiate an ARP request. An ARP request is a broadcast whereas an ARP response is a unicast
 - The ARP cache **timeout** indicates the time for which a MAC address can reside in the cache
 - The Linux command for displaying the ARP table is **arp -a**

12-1
 - The primary goal of the network layer is to transfer packets between the **source** of the data and the **final** **destination**, possibly via multiple **links**
 - The network layer is responsible for routing (i.e., identifying the **path** that a packet must take to get from the source node to the destination node) and **forwarding** received packets to the next node along the identifed **path**
 - Which of the following additional responsibilities does the network layer have
	 - Congestion control
	 - Internetworking
- Every packet that the network layer of any node receives from the link layer is sent up to the transport layer of that node
	- False
- Which of the following is not a goal of a routing algorithm
	- Modularity
- When using shortest path routing, the shortest path is calculated and stored in a **routing table**

- Elements written in blue front represented 
	- Nodes that have been finalized
	- Nodes to which the shortest distance from the source node has been found 
- In any given iteration, nodes to which distances from the source nodes are as yet unknown are indicated using the value **infinity**.
- In every iteration, the node **with the shortest known distance from the source node** is chosen for exploration next

12-2
 - The common protocol in the **network** layer that all nodes understand is called the **Internet** Protocol
 - The Internet Protocol (IP) does not provide any **reliability** guarantees and so it is known as the **best** **effort** service
 - In Internet Protocol Version 4 protocol an IPv4 header is added to all network layer **packets** before sending them down to the **link layer**.
 - The **identification** field in the header provides a way recombine a packet that has been split into multiple **fragments**
 - If a packet has the "do not fragment" flag set and cannot move nay further becaues it is too large, it will be **dropped**.
 - IPv6 supports a **larger** address than IPv4 and has a **simpler** header than IPv4
 - Congestion is when the network gets **flooded** with more **packets** that it can handle
 - In traffic-aware **routing**, we consider the current **load** and direct traffic away from hotspots
 - In traffic **throttling**, routers track the network state and determine when **congestion** will occur
 - Load **shedding** is when routers drop packets when congestion is too high
