Humans traveled from Russia to North America then continued to travel south till they made it to warmer lands where groups began to split up, some moving east and others moving south. The coastal route theory follows a similar path to the interior route but its believed that humans traveled by sea from western Russia to the west coast of North America.

- The 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) made it possible for objects such as human remains and funerary objects to be reptriated to the orginating culture. In what way does provenance present a challenge to repatriation?
	- With the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, provenance presents a challenge to repatriation because not until recently in our history scientists haven't kept track of where humans remains and funerary object originated from. So when you have a piece of cultural history that someone found hundreds of years ago with no documentation it can be nearly impossible to return it to its owners or identify a originating culture. Also scientists want to use cultural artifacts to learn more about the past which might create a conflict and ethical issue if the owners are known and want the piece of their history back. In recent years there has been a move to create a peaceful and mutual relationship between scientists and indigenous communities with respectable terms to allow scientists to study and learn then return the artifacts to their origin.
