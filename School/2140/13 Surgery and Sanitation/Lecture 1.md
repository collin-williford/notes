Amputation without anesthetic 
- Amputation why?
	- Infection 
		- Gargrene (tissue death)
		- Speticemia (blood poisoning)
	- Amputation = treatment 
		- Infection would lead to death 

19th Centry: Surgery Focus 
- Pain minimization 
- Focus: speed, then precision 
	- Infection killed 40%
	- Quick  = "skilful"
- Amputations 
	- 1824 -> 20 minutes 
	- 1834 -> 90 seconds

- Analgesics 
	- Mandrake root, opium, alcohol
