Practicing mainly in Rome, Galen served as a physician to gladiators and later to Roman emperors, giving hiim significant oppourtunities to study human anatomy through injuries and dissections of animals. His theories, such as the four humors(blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile), aimed to explain how bodily fuluids affected health and disease. Galen's extensive writings on anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology became authorative texts for over a millennium, as his approach combined observation, experimentation and logic to understand and treat illnesses. 

Hippocrates 
- Hippocrates (460-370 BCE), known as the "Father of Medicine", was a Greek physician who revolutionized ancient medicine by rejecting supernatural explanations for disease and emphasizing natural causes and treatments. He lived and practiced on the island of Kos and throughout Greece, where he taught that health depended on the balance of the four humors: blood, phlegm, black bile, yellow bile.

These parctitioners performed a variety of tasks, including hair cutting, shaving, and dental work but they were also responsible for more invasive medical procedures such as bloodletting, amputations, tooth extractions, and treating wounds. The profession emerged in the Middle ages when medical training was not standardized and barbers, who often had basic surgical skills, became the go-to practitioners for minor surgeries. Barber-surgeons operated in public spaces and were distinguished from physicians, who had more formal education and training. Over time, the profession became more regulated, and the role of the barber-surgeon gradually evolved into specialized medical fields, with surgery eventually becoming its own disipline.
