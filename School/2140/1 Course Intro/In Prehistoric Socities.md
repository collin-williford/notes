- Scarcity of evidence 
	- We don't have a lot of written records of medicine from this time 
	- Historians want evidence and there isn't much 
- Hunter-Gatherers
- Nomadic life = little disease "support"
	- Small groups, little population, no pets/herds
		- No offal (human/animal waste)
	- Little evidence of "social diseases"
		- Diseases that are common in todays age 
- Omnivores -> abundance of food 
	- Evolutionary impact?

Pre-History
- Sick means you wil probably be abandoned
- Infanticide?
- Are healers necessary?

Illness & Injury Did Exist 
- Wild Animals 
- Parasites from water/soil/raw meat
- Injuries - hunting, childbirth 
- Famine 

Evidence: Shamans and Illness
- Drawings on caves in Zimbabwe, ca. 2000 years ago 
- Believed illness were caused by spirits 

1st Agricultural Revolution 
- End of Pelistocene Era (~ 10,000 B.C.)
	- Humans decided to settle in place
- Ice caps melted -> oceans rose so agriculture more accessible 
- Humans "settled down"
	- Permanent settlements
	- Animal husbandry 
	- Food cultivation 
	- Older people are becoming sources of information as there is still no way to write down knowledge 
		- it becomes key to keep people alive for longer so they can accumulate more information 
- Neolithic Era (~6000 B.C. - 1500 B.C.)
	- Fertile Cresent (legumes, peas)

Diseases and Settlements Societies 
- Steady food supply leads to increase in population 
- Drawbacks 
	- Constant animal proximity (sheep, dogs, cattle, pigs, poultry)
		- Keeping animals close indoors to protect them and to spread warmth at night 
	- Settlement  -> waste/refuse/pollution (feces, offal, flies)
	- Irrigation 
		- increase in water diseases 
		- socities were living near sources of water for ease of use 

Settlement Socities Spread Disease 
- Concentration = disease support 
- Disease follow people (trade, travel, war)
- Vectors transport pathogens 
- Agricultral socities need: laborors
	- Large families
	- Heal the sick 
	- Healers needed which means knowledge needs to be preserved 

Evidence: Ancient Trepanation 
- Drilling a head into the skull 
	- Some of the people survived because you can see bone growth after the drilling 

Early Medical Evidence 
- Mesopotamia 
- Ancient Babylon
- Code of Harammabi 

"The treatise of Meidcal Diagnosis and Prognosis"
- "the patient coughs continually. What he coughs up is thick and frequently bloody. His breaking sounds like a flute. His hands are cold, his feet are warm. He sweats easily, and his heart" 
	- Evidence of recording symptoms 

Egypt: Medicine, Health and Religion 
- Egyption god: Thoth
- Priests as healers
	- and mediators 
- Egyptian gods linked to body parts
- Physicians concentrating on certain ailments 
	- Iri, ("Keeper of Royal Rectum")
	- Peseshet, female physician 
	- Imhotep, astrologer-physician 

Death and Canopic Jars
- Royal bodies are sacral 
- Mummification 
	- They are wrapping up important dead people to protect them from decaying 
- Guarding visceral organs 

Health and Illness in Ancient Egypt
- Health = balance, peace with gods 
- Illness = inbalance, disfavor with gods
- Healing prx
	- Priests 
	- Temple-sleeping 
	- Practical remedies (papyri) 

Healers in the Ancient World 
- Focus on diagnoses/prognosis 
	- Predicting outcome -> why?
- Forecasting and predictions 
	- Observations: nature, evnirons, weather
