Agile Mindset
 - You will be disappointed if you use agile as a project management tool
 - Instead of working on agile practices, you should think like an agile team
 - Rather than being masters of them, try to find the reasons behind them instead
 - Self organization is one of the key characteristics of agile teams, because it's very difficult to manage a team with a top-down approach 


Agile Manifesto
 - Avoid Multi Tasking
	 - Multi tasking is the opposite of focusing 
- Focus High Value Tasks 
	- Instead of working on several different things at once, the entire team will focus on a limited set of high value tasks 
- Avoid Handoffs
	- A lot of time gets wasted waiting for someone else to finish their work
- Deliver Predictably
	- Agile teams should strive to have everyone good enough to be able to contribute something to every bit of work on the team. So you can be sure to continuously deliver at a predictable pace
- Cross Functional Team 
	- Each team member working horizontally through these function areas
	- Cross-functional teams spend a lot of time cross-training
	- Agile teams tries to be capable of contributing something to each project
- Avoid Power Point Software
	- Only show the customer working software. You need to deliver small, fully-functional features of the product to the customer in iterations (sprints) 
- Respond to change
	- Software development is much different from manufacturing. A change in the software doesn't require you to break concrete or redesign things
- Stay with timebox
	- Agile teams focus on being predictable instead of creating detailed plans 


Agile Frameworks
 - Scrum
	 - Sprint 
		 - A short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work 
	- Product Backlog
		- refers to a prioritized list of features which a produce should contain

- XP (Extreme Programming)
	- Most agile teams already use some form of XP's agile planning 
	- A few of these practices are agile planning, continuous integration, software refactoring and test-driven development 
	- Software teams use a combination of scrum and XP to help them embrace an agile mindset 
	- User Stories
		- Describe what the product should do in terms meaningful to customers and users
	- Pair Programming 
		- The code sent into production is created by two people who work together on the code to be created while sitting on a single computer
			- Enhanced software quality 
			- No effect on time to deliver
			- Cost savings for later stages
	- Test-First Programming 
		- Reduces the feedback cycle for developers to identify and resolve issues, thereby decreasing the number of bugs that get introduces into production

Workflow Management 
 - Kanban
	 - The Kanban system is a popular way to apply lean thinking to software development 
	 - Lean thinking is about focusing on what's valuable to the customer, and then continuously improving the produce over time.
