K-NN
- Supervised learning algorithm
- Use the k neighors to make decision instead of a single nearest neighbor 
- Chose the label that occurs among the majority of the k nearest neighbors (majority vote)

Pros 
- Simple and easy to implement 
- No training to implement 
- One method that does it all 

Cons 
- Accuracy suffers in high dimensions 
- Testing speed is an issue for large datasets
