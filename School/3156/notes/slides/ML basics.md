Supervised Learning 
- model is trained on a labled dataset
- each input has a corresponding output 
- Types of problems 
	- Classification 
		- predicts discrete categories (like spam/not spam)
	- Regression 
		- predicts continuous numerical values (like temperature or price)
- Applications 
	- Medical diagnosis, fraud detection 

Unsuprevised Learning 
- Data with no predefined labels 
- The model identifies patterns, clusters, or associations independently 
- Applications 
	- Customer segmentation
	- anomaly detection 

Reinforcement Learning 
- involves an agent that interacts with an environment, leaning through rewards and penalties to maximize long-term success
- no labled data 
- Applicaitons 
	- Self-driving cars
	- robotics
	- gaming
