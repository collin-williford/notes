- Supervised learning 

- Computes the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation with observed data. 
- Predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent input variables 

Simple Linear Regression 
- House selling price prediction as a function of floor size 

Multiple Linear Regression 
- House selling price prediction as a function of floor size, age, number of bedrooms 

House Price Prediction 
- Given the floor size in square feet, predict the selling price
	- x is the size, y is the price 
	- Need to learn a function h such that h(x) = f(x) 
- This is Regression
