von Neumann Architecture
 - Processing unit 
	 - Executes program instructions 
	 - Consits of two parts
		 - ALU
			 - Arithmetic/logic unit 
			 - performs math operations such as addition, sub, logical
		- Register
			- A small, fast unit of storage used to hold program data and the instructions that are being executed by the ALU
	- No distinctions between instructions and data in the von Neumann architecture 
		- instructions are data
		- Each register is therefore capable of holding one data word
- Control Unit 
	- drives program instruction execution on the processing unit. Together, the processing and control units make up the CPU
	- Also includes some storage to keep track of execution state and determine next action 
		- Program Counter(PC)
			- Keeps the memory address of the next instruction 
		- Instruction Register(IR)
			- Stores the instruction, loaded from memory, that is currently being executed 
- Memory Unit 
	- Stores program data and instructions
- Input unit
	- Load program data and instructions on the computer and initiate program execution 
- Output Unit 
	- store or receive program results
- Address Bus
	- Send the memory address of a read or write request to the memory unit 
- Data Bus
	- Transfer data between units 
- Control Bus
	- Send control signals that request or notify other units of actions
