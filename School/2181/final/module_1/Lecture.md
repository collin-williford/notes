 - Computer Architecture
	 - A blueprint of a computers hardware. It describes how all the physical components of a computers are arranged and how they interact with each other

Instruction Set Architecture
 - Defines the instructions a CPU can understand
 - Different CPUs have differnet ISAs
	 - SPARC, IA32, MIPS, ARM, and x86
- ISAs tell the CPU how to understnad and execute instructions

Microarchitecture - The Building Blocks of ISA
 - Microarchitecture is teh circuirty for a specific ISA
	 - The microarchitecture describes how a specific ISA is implemented in hardware
	 - Different microarchitectures can implement the same ISA

Types of ISAs
 - RISC
	 - Simple instructions that execute quickly
	 - Common on high-end servers and mobile devices
	 - ARM and MIPS
- CISC
	- Complex instruction that perform multiple functions
	- Common on Desktop and many server-class computers
	- x86
