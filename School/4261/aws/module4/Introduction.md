- Define Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and how it works 
- Recognize the problems that Amazon S3 can solve 
- Describe how to move data to and from Amazon S3
- Manage the storage of content efficiently by using Amazon S3
- Recommend the appropriate use of Amazon S3 based on requirements 
- Configure a static website on Amazon S3
- Use the AWS Well-Architected Framwork principles when designing a storage layer with Amazon S3

As a cloud architect working on Amazon S3:
- I need to consider access patterns and use cases of the business so that I can choose Amazon S3 configuration options that optimize cost while supporting performance and compliance requirements 
- I need to apply security best practices so that the storage layer is protected against unwanted access and accidental data loss
