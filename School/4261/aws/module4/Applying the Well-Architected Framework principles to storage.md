Key takeaways 
- Protecting data is a security best practice that Amazon S3 supports through these default configurations: encrypting objects, making objects private, blocking public access 
- You can protect data in Amazon S3 by limiting access through IAM policies and enabling versioning 
- Selecting an architecture is a performance efficiency best practice that Amazon S3 supports through its ability to store massive amounts of unstructured data 
- Amazon S3 includes performance-imporving options such as S3 Transfer Accelerator and multipart upload 
- Selecting cost-effective resources is a cost-optimization best practice that Amazon S3 supports through features such as lifecycle policies, intelligent tiering, and Amazon S3 Inventory 
- Failure management is a reliability best practice that Amazon S3 has been designed for through its durability and availability features 
- You can use Amazon S3 for backing up data to improve failure management of your applications and data
