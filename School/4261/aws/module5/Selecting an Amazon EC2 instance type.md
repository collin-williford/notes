Choosing an instance type
- With over 270 available instance types, how do you choose the right type?
	- Consider both performance requirements and cost requirements
	- Use available resources to get recomended options 
- Task 
	- Creating a new instance
		- Solution 
			- In the EC2 console, use the Instance Types page to filter by characteristics that you choose
			- Recommendation:
				- The latest generation in an instance family typically has a better price-to-performance ratio
	- Optimizing an existing instance
		- Solution 
			- You can get recommendations for optimizing the instance type by using the AWS Compute Optimizer
			- You can get recommendations and modify the instance accordingly 

AWS Compute Optimizer
- Recommends optimal instance type, instance size, and Auto Scaling group configurations
- Analyzes workload patterns and makes recomendations
- Classifies instance findings as Under-provisioned, Over-provisioned, Optimized or None

Key takeaways
- An EC2 instance type defines a configuration of CPU, memory, storage and network performance characteristics
- As a recommendation, choose new generation instances types in a family because they generally have better price-to-perform ratios
- Use the Instance Types page in the Amazon EC2 console and AWS Compute Optimizer to find the right instance type for your workload
