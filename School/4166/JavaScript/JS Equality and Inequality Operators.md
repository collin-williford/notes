 - == and != are **loose equality/inequality operators** 
	 - They only compare the values of the operands
	 - When the operands have different types, JavaScript first converts the operands to the same type and then compares 
	 - If one of the operands if an object and the other is a primitive, convert the object to a primitive
	 - If one of the operands is null or undefined, the other must also be null or undefined to return true. Otherwise return false
	 - If one of the operands is a Boolean but the other is not, convert the Boolean to a number: true is converted to 1, false is 0
	 - if one is a string and the other a number, convert the string to a number 

 - 0 == '0'
	 - return true because '0' is being converted to a number first
- 0 === '0'
	- Strict equality/inequality operands
	- return false because it compares both the values and the data types of the operands 
	- Always a good idea to use strict equality/inequality operands to avoid unexpected results caused by implicit conversion
